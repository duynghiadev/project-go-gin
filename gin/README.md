If you are looking for a web framework for Golang, then let me introduce you to Gin. Gin is simple, easy to use, and has many built in convenience methods to make your Golang web development much easier. With this framework you can easily create your own custom path routing that take HTTP methods into account, was well as easily serve data via its API methods. Gin doesn't limit your web development options but does abstract away many of the simple tasks, to make clean and concise code. Try out Gin as your next Golang project, I believe you will be pleasantly surprised, might I recommend a Golang rest API?
